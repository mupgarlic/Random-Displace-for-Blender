# Displacer - A Blender Plugin

This is a plugin I've developed a few months ago with the intention of experimenting with different random noise textures to generate random decorations / abstract structures for some props. I thought it would be cool to share it with everyone so here u go c: (the name is terrible, I kno).

# Installing

1. Download the 'RandomDisplace.py' file in this repository.
2. Go to Edit -> Preferences...

Search & select the Python file you've just downloaded.
4. The plugin is already installed! Make sure to have it ticked in this menu.

# How to use it

You'll get access to Displacer (?) at the sidebar of the 3D Viewport, on the category 'N.T. Studio':

As you can see, the design of the plugin is extremely complicated, you have 5 nasty buttons with different functions.

# High poly objects

The first three buttons add high poly versions of three primitive meshes in the scene: A plane, a cube & a sphere.

# Random textures for the 'Displace' modifier

When you click on 'Add Displace', the plugin will add a new Displace modifier to the selected object (make sure that you are in Object Mode) with a completely random procedural noise texture.

Below you'll also find the fifth button, I've added it basically 'cause I'm a newbie and I wasn't able to generate more than two textures with the same name. If you don't like the texture, make sure to click that button before pressing "Add Displace" again.
